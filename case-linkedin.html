    <h4>LinkedIn India | Glitch </h4>


    <p>LinkedIn in India is typically seen as a brand that's not too welcoming and feels like a place where only senior management and above can actually connect and converse. How might we make LinkedIn seem more open as a platform and as one for any profession?</p>

    <img src="css/LinkedIn/Slide1.png" alt="" class="image">
    <img src="css/LinkedIn/Slide2.png" alt="" class="image">

    <p>What we can understand here is that LinkedIn India‚Äôs traffic and usage stats are way below its global average. The growth rates have been phenomenal with some sources claiming ‚Äú1 new member every 2 seconds‚Äù but when it comes to repeat visit, usage and interaction patterns the performance is weak. For example: With a 49 Million user base, barely 1.82 Million are visiting per month, a 3.7% monthly active audience, who also exhibit low engagement metric reflected by 1.09 minute session times, very low pages views per session and a high bounce rates.</p>

    <img src="css/LinkedIn/Slide3.png" alt="" class="image">
    <img src="css/LinkedIn/Slide4.png" alt="" class="image">

    <p>I conducted a dip-stick to understand the usage patterns and most people said they spent time on LinkedIn only when they were looking out for jobs. Most said the response rate from LinkedIn applications was low and that they don‚Äôt completely rely on it. Most people barely knew any products, while others who knew more though that the features were available for only paid subscription. What came across was the people did not know what the platform had to offer, rest aside what they could accomplish with these features.</p>

    <video src="css/LinkedIn/LinkedIn.mp4" autoplay mute type="video/mp4"></video>

    <p>The campaign was based on the insight that members feel a sense of fulfilment when their personal and professional values align to form their own personal definition of success. The campaign was created in the US and then taken global with India being the second country for roll-out. The idea was to foster an even stronger sense of community amongst professionals, whether they are just starting out and finding their way in their careers or are already established in their own right. The people featured also reflected a glimpse of diversity and inclusion of contemporary careers.</p>

    <p>But considering the radical difference between the workforce‚Äôs culture in the United States and that oin India, made me dig deeper into the feasibility of this unified approach.</p>

    <img src="css/LinkedIn/Slide8.png" alt="" class="image">
    <img src="css/LinkedIn/Slide9.png" alt="" class="image">

    <p>Hofstede Insights‚Äô Country Comparison Tool is a metric that aims to provide practical means of understanding the impact Culture has on work and life across different countries. We start off with a contrast between, the United States and India. It is a metricized version of our otherwise beliefs and opinions.</p>

    <img src="css/LinkedIn/Slide10.png" alt="" class="image">

    <p>This dimension deals with the fact that all individuals in societies are not equal ‚Äì it expresses the attitude of the culture towards these inequalities amongst us. Power Distance is defined as¬†the extent to which the less powerful members of institutions and organisations within a country expect and accept that power is distributed unequally.</p>

    <p>India scores high on this dimension, 77, indicating an appreciation for hierarchy and a top-down structure in society and organizations. If one were to encapsulate the Indian attitude, one could use the following words and phrases : dependent on the boss or the power holder for direction, acceptance of un-equal rights between the power-privileged and those who are lesser down in the pecking order, immediate superiors accessible but one layer above less so, paternalistic leader, management directs, gives reason / meaning to ones work life and rewards in exchange for loyalty from employees. Real Power is centralized even though it may not appear to be and managers count on the obedience of their team members. Employees expect to be directed clearly as to their functions and what is expected of them. Control is familiar, even a psychological security, and attitude towards managers are formal even if one is on first name basis. Communication is top down and directive in its style and often feedback which is negative is never offered up the ladder. </p>

    <p>This reflects that our audiences are more formal, reserved, cautious and are not vocal when it comes their feelings and opinions about their workplace. </p>
